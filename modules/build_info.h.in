/*
    BUILD_TIMESTAMP contains the date of the latest make issued when the
    repository status changed.

    If modifications are done when GIT_STATUS is already "dirty",
    this date will not be updated. Going from clean to dirty or vice versa
    or a new commit will cause this date to be updated when make is launched.

    It is kept for backward compatibility and we advise that you
    use GIT_VERSION instead. Frequent commits and personnal/feature/bugfix
    branches will remove the reliance on the BUILD_TIMESTAMP to track code states.
