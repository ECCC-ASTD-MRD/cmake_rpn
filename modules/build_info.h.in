/* The next define directive gives access to a timestamp of when the make command was issued.

    NOTE: This means that even if no code was changed, all files that include this one will
    be rebuilt. Furthermore, it will cascade to all other files depending on those files.
    This will add significant time when re-building, especially for a large projects with
    sub-projects.

    Unless this is this is absolutely necessary for your project, we advise that you
    use GIT_VERSION instead.

    Frequent commits and personnal/feature/bugfix branches will remove the reliance on the
    BUILD_TIMESTAMP to track code states.

    To enable BUILD_TIMESTAMP, uncomment the next definition and add @ at each side of
    BUILD_TIMESTAMP inside the double quotes.
